I've expanded "etc." to "et cetera" passim to yield a tokenization that may be consistently lemmatized. (affected are l1_2005-09.txt l1_2007-04.txt l1_2008-09.txt l1_2010-09.txt l1_2011-04.txt l2_1977-09.txt l2_1990-09.txt l2_2000-09.txt l2_2012-09.txt).

in several exams (e.g. l1_2015-04 text 1, and l1_2014 someplace) I removed in-text numbering so the exam would be easier to divide into individual texts, and so we don't get metadata counted towards text length.
